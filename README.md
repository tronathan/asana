# Asana

This gem is a simple Ruby wrapper for the Asana REST API based on rbright/asana.  I attempted to modify it to support the OAuth token supplied by Asana's OAuth strategy instead of use the api_key method, but ran into issues related to class vs instance usage: https://github.com/rbright/asana/issues/16

To learn more, check out the [Asana API Documentation][].

See https://github.com/rbright/asana for Installation and Usage.
